# math-api
api no database does simple math


*Challenge*

Create a simple API that has 2 routes, /math/add, /math/subtract. When you hit /math/add/x/y it should add x and y together and return the result. Same idea with subtract.

After that works, make another two routes /math/addJSON and /math/subtractJSON that you can send a JSON object {num1: x, num2, y} to and it returns the result, same idea with subtract.
